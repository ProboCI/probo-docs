Recipes are prewritten `.probo.yaml` configuration files you can use and amend to suit your particular needs. If you've written a rather clever and/or useful recipe, consider [contributing it](https://github.com/proboci/probo-docs#contribute-your-proboyaml-recipe) on GitHub. The Probo docs are Open Source and pull requests are welcome!
